c(5, 7, 9, 8) #concatenates a series of items/objects
?apply #checks what a function is about (opens a new window about the function)
x <- c(9.0, 5.2, 7.1) # this syntax allows a function (right hand side-RHS) to be saved into an object (LHS; e.g., var name, etc), and thus usable for future operations
